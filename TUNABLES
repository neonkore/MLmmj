TUNABLES for lists managed with mlmmj:
--------------------------------------

The following files can be used for changing the behaviour of a list. The
filename is supposed to be below listdir/control. In the case it's a "boolean",
the contents of a file does not matter, the mere presence of it, will set the
variable to "true". If it's a "normal" file, the first line will be used as
value, leaving line 2 and forward ready for commentary etc. If it's possible
to specify several entries (one pr. line), it's marked "list".

  listaddress			(list)

   This file contains all addresses which mlmmj sees as listaddresses (see
   tocc below). The first one is the one used as the primary one, when mlmmj
   sends out mail.

  closedlist			(boolean)

   Is the list is open or closed. If it's closed subscription and
   unsubscription via mail is disabled.

  closedlistsub		(boolean)

   Closed for subscription. Unsubscription is possible.

  moderated			(boolean)

   If this file is present, the emailaddresses in the file
   listdir/control/moderators will act as moderators for the list.

  submod			(list)

   If this file is present, subscription will be moderated by owner(s).
   If there are emailaddresses in this file, then these will be used
   instead of owner.

  tocc				(boolean)

   If this file is present, the list address does not have to be in the To:
   or Cc: header of the email to the list.

  subonlypost			(boolean)

   When this file is present, only people who are subscribed to the list,
   are allowed to post to it. The check is made against the "From:" header.

  prefix			(normal)

   The prefix for the Subject: line of mails to the list. This will alter the
   Subject: line, and add a prefix if it's not present elsewhere.

  owner			(list)

   The emailaddresses in this file (1 pr. line) will get mails to
   listname+owner@listdomain.tld

  customheaders		(list)

   These headers are added to every mail coming through. This is the place you
   want to add Reply-To: header in case you want such.

  delheaders			(list)

   In this file is specified *ONE* headertoken to match pr. line. If the file
   consists of:
                   Received:
                   Message-ID:
   Then all occurences of these headers in incoming list mail will be deleted.
   "From " and "Return-Path:" are deleted no matter what.

  access			(list)

   If this file exists, all headers of a post to the list is matched against
   the rules. The first rule to match wins. See README.access for syntax and
   examples.

  memorymailsize		(normal)

   Here is specified in bytes how big a mail can be and still be prepared for
   sending in memory. It's greatly reducing the amount of write system calls to
   prepare it in memory before sending it, but can also lead to denial of
   service attacks. Default is 16k (16384 bytes).

  addtohdr			(boolean)

   When this file is present, a To: header including the recipients
   emailaddress will be added to outgoing mail. Recommended usage is to remove
   existing To: headers with delheaders (see above) first.

  relayhost			(normal)

   The host specified (IP address or hostname, both works) in this file will
   be used for relaying the mail sent to the list. Defaults to 127.0.0.1.

  notifysub			(boolean)

   If this file is present, the owner(s) will get a mail with the address of
   someone sub/unsubscribing to a mailinglist.

  digestinterval		(normal)

   This file specifies how many seconds will pass before the next digest is
   sent. Defaults to 604800 seconds, which is 7 days.

  digestmaxmails		(normal)

   This file specifies how many mails can accumulate before digest sending is
   triggered. Defaults to 50 mails, meaning that if 50 mails arrive to the list
   before digestinterval have passed, the digest is delivered.

  bouncelife			(normal)

   Here is specified for how long time in seconds an address can bounce before
   it's unsubscribed. Defaults to 432000 seconds, which is 5 days.

  noarchive			(boolean)

   If this file exists, the mail won't be saved in the archive but simply
   deleted.

  nosubconfirm			(boolean)

   If this file exists, no mail confirmation is needed to subscribe to the
   list. This should in principle never ever be used, but there is times
   on local lists etc. where this is useful. HANDLE WITH CARE!

  noget			(boolean)

   If this file exists, then retrieving old posts with +get-N is disabled

  subonlyget			(boolean)

   If this file exists, then retrieving old posts with +get-N is only
   possible for subscribers. The above mentioned 'noget' have precedence.

  verp				(normal)

   Enable VERP support. Anything added in this variable will be appended the
   MAIL FROM: line. If "postfix" is put in the file, it'll make postfix use
   VERP by adding XVERP=-= to the MAIL FROM: line.

  maxverprecips		(normal)

   How many recipients pr. mail delivered to the smtp server. Defaults to 100.

  notoccdenymails		(boolean)
  noaccessdenymails		(boolean)
  nosubonlydenymails		(boolean)

   These switches turns off whether mlmmj sends out notification about postings
   being denied due to the listaddress not being in To: or Cc: (see 'tocc'),
   when it was rejected due to an access rule (see 'access') or whether it's a
   subscribers only posting list (see 'subonlypost').

  smtpport			(normal)

   In this file a port other than port 25 for connecting to the relayhost
   can be specified.

  delimiter			(normal)

   This specifies what to use as recipient delimiter for the list.
   Default is "+".

  nodigesttext			(boolean)

   If this file exists, digest mails won't have a text part with a thread
   summary.
