TUNABLES for lists managed with mlmmj:
--------------------------------------

The following files can be used for changing the behaviour of a list. The
filename is supposed to be below listdir/control. In the case it's a "boolean",
the contents of a file does not matter, the mere presence of it, will set the
variable to "true". If it's a "normal" file, the first line will be used as
value, leaving line 2 and forward ready for commentary etc.

  closedlist			(boolean)

   Is the list is open or closed. If it's closed subscribtion and
   unsubscription via mail is disabled. Also note that confirmation is disabled
   too, so the -C option to mlmmj-sub and mlmmj-unsub is of no use with a
   closed list.

  moderated			(boolean)

   If this file is present, the emailaddresses in the file listdir/moderators
   will act as moderators for the list.

  tocc				(boolean)

   If this file is present, the list address does not have to be in the To:
   or Cc: header of the email to the list.

  subonlypost			(boolean)

   When this file is present, only people who are subscribed to the list,
   are allowed to post to it. The check is made against the "From:" header.

  prefix			(normal)

   The prefix for the Subject: line of mails to the list. This will alter the
   Subject: line, and add a prefix if it's not present elsewhere.
