TUNABLES for lists managed with mlmmj:
--------------------------------------

The following files can be used for changing the behaviour of a list. The
filename is supposed to be below listdir/control. In the case it's a "boolean",
the contents of a file does not matter, the mere presence of it, will set the
variable to "true". If it's a "normal" file, the first line will be used as
value, leaving line 2 and forward ready for commentary etc. If it's possible
to specify several entries (one pr. line), it's marked "list".


  closedlist			(boolean)

   Is the list is open or closed. If it's closed subscribtion and
   unsubscription via mail is disabled. Also note that confirmation is disabled
   too, so the -C option to mlmmj-sub and mlmmj-unsub is of no use with a
   closed list.


  moderated			(boolean)

   If this file is present, the emailaddresses in the file listdir/moderators
   will act as moderators for the list.



  tocc				(boolean)

   If this file is present, the list address does not have to be in the To:
   or Cc: header of the email to the list.


  subonlypost			(boolean)

   When this file is present, only people who are subscribed to the list,
   are allowed to post to it. The check is made against the "From:" header.


  prefix			(normal)

   The prefix for the Subject: line of mails to the list. This will alter the
   Subject: line, and add a prefix if it's not present elsewhere.


  owner			(list)

   The emailaddresses in this file (1 pr. line) will get mails to
   listname+owner@listdomain.tld


  delheaders			(list)

   In this file is specified *ONE* headertoken to match pr. line. If the file
   consists of:
                   Received:
                   Message-ID:
   Then all occurences of these headers in incoming list mail will be deleted.
   "From " and "Return-Path:" are deleted no matter what.


  access			(list)

   If this file exists, all headers of a post to the list is matched against
   the rules. The first rule to match wins. See README.access for syntax and
   examples.

  memorymailsize		(normal)

   Here is specified in bytes how big a mail can be and still be prepared for
   sending in memory. It's greatly reducing the amount of write system calls to
   prepare it in memory before sending it, but can also lead to denial of
   service attacks. Default is 16k (16384 bytes).

  addtohdr			(boolean)

   When this file is present, a To: header including the recipients
   emailaddress will be added to outgoing mail. Recommended usage is to remove
   existing To: headers with delheaders (see above) first.
