This applies to everyone using mlmmj > 0.5.2:

 Following directories have moved into the control/ directory since that
 is where they rightfully belong:

   listaddress
   moderators

 The following directory can be deleted:

   moderation/queue

 Start mlmmj-maintd

This applies to everyone using mlmmj > 0.5.1:
---------------------------------------------

 Following directories have to be created:

   listdir/requeue/
   listdir/queue/discarded/

 The footer and customheaders file are now to be placed in the control/
 directory where they belong, so they should be moved there from listdir.

This applies to everyone using mlmmj > 0.5.0:
---------------------------------------------

 Note that listdir/subcribers is no longer used for subscribers. Instead
 every file in listdir/subscribers.d/ is used.

 A quick way to convert:

 $ for i in `cat listdir/subscribers` ; do mlmmj-sub -a $i -L listdir ; done

 And then remove listdir/subscribers.

 A quick and dirty hack would be to simply move listdir/subscribers into
 subscribers.d/. This could lead to double subscriptions, so use with caution!
